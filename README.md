This file resolves a failure when creating a new VM from a macOS 10.12 Developer Preview.app 

The file "Create Mavericks Insatller.tool" must replace the existing one located in: /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/

Once replaced, users will be able to drag and drop the .app onto Fusion to begin the installation.
