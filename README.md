This file resolves a failure when creating a new VM from the "Install 10.12 Developer Preview.app" 

The file "Create Mavericks Installer.tool" must replace the existing one located in: /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/

Once replaced, you will be able to drag and drop the .app onto Fusion to begin the installation.
